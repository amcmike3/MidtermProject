						<br /> <em>“Be proactive, market yourself as if you were
							marketing a business (brand you!). Take time to quantify your
							talents and learn to speak comfortably regarding accomplishments.
							Create a job search system for introducing, applying, and
							following up on leads/interviews. Plan your work, work your
							plan. A job search IS a job. Treat yourself to free or low-cost
							perks to reward effort, you earned it!”</em> <strong> – Cindy

						yourself, strengths and weaknesses. Be aware of the kinds of job
						responsibilities and tasks you enjoy and those that you don’t
						enjoy so much. Know what you are looking for in an employer and
						position. Focus on opportunities that are a good fit. Be congruent
						in expressing who you are and your accomplishments on your cover
						letter, resume, and during the interview. The whole while, be
						yourself!”</em> <br> <strong>– Karen</strong></p>
